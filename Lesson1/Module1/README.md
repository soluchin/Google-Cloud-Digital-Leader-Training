# Module 1: Why cloud technology is revolutionizing business

### Introduction
- The technology invention history: Printing press, steam engine, electricity, transportation age, the first computer and the cloud technology.
- Each invention triggered thousands of innovations. They have one thing in common, they increase the supply and demand at the same time.
- On the supply side, technology can improve productivity. On demand side, technology increase the consumption and generates more demand.
- Also cloud technology is transforming how businesses create value, how people work and how people live.

## What Is Cloud Technology
- The cloud is metaphor for the network of data centers that store and compute information available through the Internet.
- Including the computers, software, network and security system become one unit, namely the cloud.

- Cloud deliver predictive capabilities, high performance analytics, and
- Enables businessess to produce equipment downtime, accurate supply planning and maintain leaner operational organizations.
## How Cloud Works?
- Cloud combine extraordinary compute engine and large amounts of data to create new experiences.
- Computing engines its most basic in any task that requires a calculation. Computing is the ability to process information, to store, retrieve and analyze it, and automate tasks most often done by a computer program.
- Compute power refers to the speed a computer is able to process data.
- TPU's power 50x more powerful and quantum computing 100mx more powerful than traditional chips. 
- Data is most needed to unlock the cloud capability to self-learning from the input to the output of data.
