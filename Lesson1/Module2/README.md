# Module 2: Digital Transformation with Google Cloud

### Introduction
- Customer expectations around the world dramatically changed.
- Customers now expect relevant and easily accessible content and information almost instantly.
- They also expect service always running and available anywhere around the world.
- New cloud paradigm requires to operate in new ways to meet personalized expectations.

## Digital Transformation Challenges &  Opportinities
**Culture change to encourage**, business model must adapt to remain relevalt customer expectation 
- In many cases small business leveraging clou technology have been able disrupt industries
- Market organization need to be innovative, agile, fast (quick to market), costumer-focused
- Cloud technology gives same opportunity for large and small business  

**Transform IT infrastructure**
- IT has traditionally required significant upfront spending and ensuring hardware is ready to go regardless of when and how much is used.
- Whereas cloud technology only pays for the infrastructure it wants and when to use, this is including scalable rent  

**Business platform**
- essentially talk about enabling integration between system an granting user the correct access privileges in an organization or beyond through APIs  

**Application Models**
- widely used to refer programs and software that enabled people to perform various diigital tasks.
- The way to realize it by using developer operation (DevOps) and aim to increase software delivery velocity, improve services reliability, and build shared ownership amongst software stackholders 

**Unlocking value of data**  
- Leveraging data relies on being able to capture, store and structure it that you can make informed business decision with it.
- Data no longer about retrospective insight, but includes real-time insight.
- By using ML and AI, we can generate insight from data both past and present, also you can perceives, predict, recommend and categorize new data
- example: ML enable to predict maintenance manufacture, analyze every click made by the user to personalize, and try to analyze images 

**Security Model**  
Security in the cloud requires a different way. Traditionally IT security model focused on keepeeng threats out, they build an on-premises perimeter that individuals required access to in order to gain entry. That models work when all hardware and systems weren't controlled and managed centrally and employees came into the office to do their work.  
Lately employees need to share and access information virtually, and move the infrastructure to te cloud. In the cloud, best practice for security is called a shared responsibility security model.  
Cloud provider is responsible for the physical infrasctructure like underwater cables, data centers, the personnel to manage and businesses are responsible for controlling data and resources access. Which means businesses need to think carefully about appropriate governance and polices for granting, and restricting access to information and applications.
